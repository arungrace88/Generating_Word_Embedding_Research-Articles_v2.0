Creating word embedding from a small corpus of research articles using Python package - **gensim**.

The research articles were provided as part of a Hackathon hosted by Analystics Vidhya -[HackLive3](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/hacklive-3-guided-hackathon-text-classification/).

The resulting word embedding has 15140 tokens with 100 dimension. A screen shot from the generated word embedding is shown below:
